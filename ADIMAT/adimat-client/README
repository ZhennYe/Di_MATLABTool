This is the sub-project of ADiMat, adimat-client. It contains only the
command-line client programm for accessing the transformation
server. This was separated into a sub-project because it shall be
released in source, in order to allow people with operating systems
that we do not support directly, like MacOS, BSD, AIX, etc. to compile
the client for their system.

For instructions to build and install adimat-client, see the file
INSTALL. You should use a prefix that matches your ADIMAT_HOME
variable, but this is not strictly required. If you don't make sure to
remove the (probably uncooperative) adimat-client executable that came
with the full ADiMat distribution and that adimat-client is found on
the PATH.

First, run the bootstrap script to run the various autotools:

$ boostrap

Then run configure:

$ ./configure --prefix=$ADIMAT_HOME

Then make and make install:

$ make
$ make install
