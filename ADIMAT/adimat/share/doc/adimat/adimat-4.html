<P>It is assumed, that the reader is familiar with the general technique
of automatic differentiation (AD). That is, the keywords independent and
dependent variable and top-level function are familiar to him. Some
recommended literature on the subject is the book 
<A HREF="adimat-19.html#Griewank">Evaluating Derivative</A> or the papers 
<A HREF="adimat-19.html#Iri">The History of AD</A> or 
<A HREF="adimat-19.html#adifor">ADiFor user manual</A>.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc4.1">General description</A>
</H2>

<P>ADiMat applies the source transformation approach of automatic
differentiation to Matlab programs. A Matlab program consists of one
or more m-files defining functions. The file that contains the
starting point of the computation (the top level function) is called
the master file. The computation of derivatives with ADiMat consists
of two steps:
<OL>
<LI><B>Transformation</B> of the source code to produce differentiated
code.</LI>
<LI><B>Evaluation</B> of the transformed function to compute the
actual derivative numbers.</LI>
</OL>

For most users the best option should be to use the functions
admDiffFor, admDiffVFor, and admDiffRev, described in
the 
<A HREF="#hlui">next section</A>, which perform both steps
automatically. However, both steps can be still done individually,
which may be necessary when you want to use special features of
ADiMat. If you are interested in the details, read the sections
<A HREF="#transformation">Source code transformation</A> and
<A HREF="#evaluation">Running the transformed code</A> later in
this chapter.</P>
<H2><A NAME="hlui"></A> <A NAME="ss4.2">4.2</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc4.2">High level user interface </A>
</H2>

<P>The Jacobian matrix of the top-level function, evaluated at certain
arguments, is computed by the functions admDiffFor, admDiffVFor, and
admDiffRev. These functions all have the same interface, and the
expect the name of or a handle to the top level function, the seed
matrix and the function arguments in that order. Thus you can easily
switch between forward and reverse mode and experiment with different
seed matrices.
<UL>
<LI>
<P>In <EM>forward mode</EM> (FM) of AD, you can compute the product J*S of the
<EM>Jacobian matrix</EM> J of a function f at arguments arg1, ...,
argN and a <EM>seed matrix</EM> S. In theory, the computational
expense (time and memory) depends linearly on the number
of <B>columns</B> of S.</P>
<P>The following functions implement the forward mode of AD in ADiMat:
<DL>
<DT><B>admDiffFor(@f, S, arg1, ..., argN, opts)</B><DD>
<P>Classic FM
implementation in ADiMat.</P>
<DT><B>admDiffVFor(@f, S, arg1, ..., argN, opts)</B><DD>
<P>New FM implementation
in ADiMat.</P>
</DL>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>In <EM>reverse mode</EM> (RM) of AD, you can compute the product
S*J of a seed matrix S and the Jacobian matrix J of a function f at
arguments arg1, ..., argN. In theory, the computational expense in
time depends linearly on the number of <B>rows</B> of S. The memory
required is in the order of the runtime of f, as all variable values
that are overwritten have to be recorded on one of
the 
<A HREF="adimat-6.html#runtime_stacks">stacks provided by ADiMat</A>. You
can use the directive 
<A HREF="adimat-10.html#recompute">recompute</A> to trade
off memory for runtime.

<P>RM

</DL>
</P>
</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Options can be given to the <B>admDiff*</B> routines using a
structure constructed with the function <B>admOptions</B>. It must
be given to them as the last argument. The
function <B>admOptions</B> takes a sequence of name and value pairs,
as shown in the following example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
opts = admOptions('independents', [1]);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Passing this options struct to <B>admDiff*</B> tells ADiMat to
differentiate the function only with respect to the first
parameter. Some names can also be abbreviated, e.g. 'i' can be used as
short for 'independendents', and 'd' can be used for 'dependendents':
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
opts = admOptions('i', [1]);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>For the full list of abbreviations refer to the online help of
admOptions. You can also set items of the option struct by assigning
to it:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
opts.independents = [1];
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Derivatives can also be computed with ADiMat using one of two
<EM>numerical differentiation</EM> methods. Thus you can easily check
AD results by comparing them to the results of these two non-AD
methods. Both methods descibed below are conceptually comparable to
the forward mode of AD, i.e. they return a product J*S of the Jacobian
of f and the given seed matrix S.
<UL>
<LI>The <EM>finite differences</EM> (FD) method, sometimes also
called the divided differences method, is almost always applicable,
except near discontinuities, but it produces only quite inaccurate
derivatives, cf.
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_differentiation">Wikipedia, Numerical differentiation</A>. You should use the
option fdStep to set the step length h to the adequate value for your
problem. The central FD method is used by default, you can also
specify the forward or backward FD method via the option fdMode.

</LI>
<LI>The <EM>complex variable</EM> method was first divised by Lyness
and Moler, and provides accurate derivatives, but it is only
applicable then the function f is <EM>real analytic</EM>,
cf. 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_differentiation#Complex_variable_methods">Wikipedia, Complex variable methods</A>.

</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>With these two functions, you may also differentiate anonymous or
lambda functions, as the function source code is not required. For
example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
J = admDiffFD(@(x,y) atan2(x, y), 1, 1, 2)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<H2><A NAME="higherOrder"></A> <A NAME="ss4.3">4.3</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc4.3">Higher order derivatives </A>
</H2>

<P>ADiMat can, to a limited extend, compute higher order derivatives
as well. Some ADiMat interface compute univariate Taylor coefficients,
and there is also a driver to compute Hessian matrices. In this
section we consider the function polynom:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
function r = polynom(x, c)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<H3><A NAME="taylor"></A> Taylor-Coefficients </H3>

<P>The function admTaylorFor can compute exact Taylor coefficients. By
setting option derivOrder, you can specify which Taylor coefficients
to compute. Note that all Taylor coefficients up to the maximum
derivOrder will be computed, but only those requested will be
returned. admTaylorFor uses an operator overloading (OO) approach, so
there is no source transformation involved.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Taylor1_10 = admTaylorFor(@polynom, 1, 2, [1 1 1 1 1], admOptions('o', 1:10))
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The Taylor objects that admTaylorFor uses can also be used manually,
for more information see the example 
<A HREF="adimat-17.html#ex_taylor_class">Using Taylor objects</A>.
Another version of the function is admTaylorVFor, which uses a similar
AD approach as admDiffVFor:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Taylor1_10 = admTaylorVFor(@polynom, 1, 2, [1 1 1 1 1], admOptions('o', 1:10))
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>admDiffFD and admDiffFor can also compute Taylor
coefficients. admDiffFD can compute up to fourth order Taylor
coefficients. Note that admDiffFD will only compute the derivative
orders requested. admDiffFor can compute second order Taylor
coefficients. Note that this is implemented by computing the full
Hessian matrix and then returning only the diagonal.</P>
<H3><A NAME="hessians"></A> Hessians </H3>

<H3>Hessians using admHessian</H3>

<P>admDiffHessian is the general driver for computing a Hessian
matrix. You can use it as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
adopts = admOptions;
H = admHessian(@polynom, 1, x, c, adopts)
H = admHessian(@polynom, W, x, c, adopts)
H = admHessian(@polynom, {Y, W}, x, c, adopts)
H = admHessian(@polynom, {'s', W}, x, c, adopts)
H = admHessian(@polynom, {Y, V, W}, x, c, adopts)
H = admHessian(@polynom, {'s', V, W}, x, c, adopts)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>It can use one of two basic strategies, which are selected by the
option hessianStrategy in the options structure that may be given as
the last argument:
<UL>
<LI>'t1rev': Forward over reverse mode</LI>
<LI>'t2for': Interpolation of second order Taylor coefficients</LI>
<LI>'for2': Second order forward mode</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The first is the default. It uses the same OO approach as
admTaylorFor, but it runs the function differentiated in RM, not the
original function. This approach can compute the full Hessian with an
overhead of O(n).</P>
<P>The second strategy, 't2for' relies on one of functions that can
compute second order Taylor-coefficients. The option admDiffFunction
controls which underlying function is used to compute the required
univariate Taylor coefficients. Possible options are admTaylorFor,
admTaylorVFor, and admDiffFD.</P>
<P>The third strategy, 'for2' invokes the function admDiffFor2 which
computes second order derivatives by running a code produced by
applying the FM ST twice. This mode can be either used with the
'scalar_directderivs' RE, which results in strip-mining in scalar
mode, or you can use one of the derivative classes 'opt_derivclass' or
'opt_sp_derivclass', which will use vector mode.</P>
<P>The second argument specifies the seed matrices. It may either be a
single matrix W, or a cell array of two matrices {Y, W}, or a cell
array of three matrices {Y, V, W}. As usual, a scalar 1 is a shortcut
for a conforming identity matrix. Matrices that are not specified are
also treated as if a scalar 1 was given.</P>
<P>If we first consider a scalar function, and let Y = 1, then
admHessian will return the matrix product V<SUP>T</SUP> * H * W. That
is, V must be a (n x p) matrix and W must be a (n x q) matrix. With
strategy t1rev, such a Hessian-matrix product has an overhead of O(q),
and with strategy t2for or for2 it has an overhead of O(p*q). Strategy t2for
has an upper limit of costs as O(n*(n+1)/2), as these are the costs
for computing a full Hessian.</P>
<P>When the function is vector valued, the result will be the product
V<SUP>T</SUP> * H * W of the <I>component Hessians</I> H of
the m output components arranged in a (p x q x m) tensor array. With
strategy t1rev, the overhead is then O(q*m), and with strategy t2for
or for2 the overhead is O(p*q).</P>
<P>The second argument may also be a cell array of three matrices {Y,
V, W}. In this case, V and W are as above and Y must be a (r x m)
matrix, the so called adjoint weight matrix. The result will then be a
tensor of dimensions (p x q x r) with the r weighted sums of the
component Hessians. In particular, if the adjoint weight matrix is a
row vector of length m, then admHessian will compute a weighted sum of
the Hessians. With strategy t1rev, the overhead is then O(q*r), and
with strategy t2for or for2 the overhead is O(p*q).</P>
<P>A special value for Y is the string 's', or 'sum', which
expands to a row vector of ones, that is, admHessian will then compute
the sum of Hessians. An alternative way to set a adjoint weight matrix
Y is to use the option field seedRev.</P>
<P>Setting a adjoint weight matrix is particularly interesting when
the sum of component Hessians weighed by Lagrangian multipliers is
desired, such as it is required by the fmincon solver. In this case,
it is not necessary to construct a function for multiplying the
contraints by the Lagrangian multiplier. Just set the adjoint weight
matrix to the Lagrangian weights and differentiate the original
constraints function. This has the advantage that you obtain both the
Jacobian of the original function and the Hessian of the Lagrangian in
one go and you can exploint the efficiency of the reverse mode.</P>
<H3>Shortcut Hessian drivers</H3>

<P>While admHessian defaults to the FM-over-RM mode, you have to set
some options to get the other modes described in the previous
section. Therefor we provide some convenience drivers, for the case of
hessianStrategy set to t2for, as follows:
<UL>
<LI>admHessFor: admDiffFunction set to admTaylorFor</LI>
<LI>admHessVFor: admDiffFunction set to admTaylorVFor</LI>
<LI>admHessFD: admDiffFunction set to admDiffFD</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>For hessianStrategy set to for2, you can also invoke admDiffFor2
directly.</P>
<P>Finally admHessRev is the driver for Hessians in
forward-oer-reverse mode, which is the default strategy of admHessian.</P>
<H3>Hessians by recursive application of admDiff</H3>

<P>You can use the admDiff* functions recursively. Recall the first
order invocation, evaluating first order derivatives of the polynom
with coefficients <CODE>c = [1 1 1 1 1]</CODE> at <CODE>x = 2</CODE>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Jacobian = admDiffFD(@polynom, 1, 2, [1 1 1 1 1])
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You have to tell the outer invocation to differentiate the inner
call only with the respect the function arguments. Thus, the recursive
application for second order derivatives, using admDiffComplex as the
outer differentiation function would be as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Hessian = admDiffComplex(@admDiffFD, 1, @polynom, 1, 2, [1 1 1 1 1], admOptions('i', [3 4]))
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you also want to have the Jacobian and the function results,
tell the outer admDiff* function how many outputs to expect from the
inner, but also to only consider the first for differentiation:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[Hessian, Jacobian, r] = admDiffComplex(@admDiffFD, 1, @polynom, 1, 2, [1 1 1 1 1],
                               admOptions('i', [3 4], 'nargout', 3, 'd', 1))
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The following combinations of admDiff* functions are possible:
<UL>
<LI>FD over FD, Complex, For, VFor, or Rev</LI>
<LI>Complex over FD, For, VFor, or Rev</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>You cannot use one of the AD-functions on top of each other, as
ADiMat can usually not differentiate the code it produces. Complex
over Complex does not work as the function to differentiate has to be
real analytic.</P>
<P>When using FD over FD, you usually have to increase the step
length, to approximately <CODE>h = sqrt(sqrt(eps))</CODE>, when the function
arguments are about one:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
admDiffFD(@admDiffFD, 1, @polynom, 1, 2, [1 1 1 1 1], admOptions('i', [3 4], 'fdStep', sqrt(sqrt(eps))))
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You can compute products of the Hessian times a matrix or vector.
You can pass the latter to either invocation:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Hv = admDiffFD(@admDiffFD, v, @polynom, 1, 2, [1 1 1 1 1], admOptions('i', [3 4], 'fdStep', 0.001))
Hv = admDiffFD(@admDiffFD, 1, @polynom, v, 2, [1 1 1 1 1], admOptions('i', [3 4], 'fdStep', 0.001))
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you use AD as the inner differentiation function, use the first
option, as then the AD process will be run just once.</P>
<H3><A NAME="taylorrm"></A> Taylor-Coefficients in Reverse Mode </H3>

<P>The function admTaylorRev can propagate Taylor coefficients across
the function differentiated in RM. This is the same as computing a
Hessian with hessianStrategy set to t1rev, only that option derivOrder
is set to something larger than 1. admTaylorRev uses an operator
overloading (OO) approach for the Taylor coefficients, just like
admTaylorFor.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
dTaylor1_10 = admTaylorRev(@polynom, 1, 2, [1 1 1 1 1], admOptions('o', 1:10))
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The same kind of derivatives can be obtained with ADOL-C or CppAD
by performing FM passes up to order M = max(derivOrder) followed by a
single RM pass over the tape.</P>
<P>The second argument can be a single seed matrix S, or a cell array
of the two seed matrices Y and S. S represents the first order
derivatives of the inputs and Y the first order adjoints of the
outputs. When S is an (n x q) matrix and Y a (p x m) matrix, then the
ouput will be a (n x q x p x M) tensor. As usual, a scalar one stands
for a conforming identity matrix. In particular, setting the second
argument to 1 or to {1, 1}, the result will be a (n x q x m x M)
tensor.</P>
<P>With derivOrder = 1 admTaylorRev returns the same results as
admHessian. In particular, setting derivOrder = 1, and Y = ones(1, m)
will yield the sum of the Hessian matrices of the outputs.</P>
<H2><A NAME="transformation"></A> <A NAME="ss4.4">4.4</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc4.4">Source code transformation </A>
</H2>

<P>The source transformation step is usually performed implicitly by
one of the 
<A HREF="#hlui">high level interface</A> functions. They
will check whether the required differentiated function exists and is
up-to-date. Otherwise they use the function admTransform to produce
the differentiated code.</P>
<P>The following sections explains how to perform this step manually.</P>
<H3>Source transformation from within Matlab</H3>

<P>From within Matlab, differentiated code can be produced by the
function admTransform. For forward mode transformation is done using
the command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
admTransform(@lighthouse)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Otherwise, you have to specify the desired transformation mode using
the options structure. For the alternative forward mode transformation
use:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
admTransform(@lighthouse, admOptions('m', 'f'))
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>For the reverse mode transformation use:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
admTransform(@lighthouse, admOptions('m', 'r'))
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<H3>Source transformation from the command line</H3>

<P>The transformation can also be done from the command line, using
the command adimat-client (or admproc or admproc-bin, if
present). This requires that the environment variable ADIMAT_HOME is
set, see the 
<A HREF="adimat-2.html#installation">installation</A> section. The
filename of the master file is given as the command line argument:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
adimat-client lighthouse.m
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This produces code differentiated in forward mode, which is written to
the file g_lighthouse.m. The adimat command currently produces many
errors and warning messages which can for the most part be ignored. If
the result file is generated and the command exits with success
everything should be fine.</P>
<P>An alternative forward mode transformation can be done using the -f
switch, which produces the file d_lighthouse.m..
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
adimat-client -f lighthouse.m
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Reverse mode differentiation of code can be done using the -r
switch, which produces the file a_lighthouse.m.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
adimat-client -r lighthouse.m
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc4.5">Running the transformed code</A>
</H2>

<P>
<A NAME="evaluation"></A> </P>
<P>As a second step, the differentiated code must be run to compute
the derivative for some input arguments. This should also preferably
be done using the 
<A HREF="#hlui">high level interface</A>
functions. In the following section describe the steps to perform this
process manually. You can also read this section to gain a better
understanding into the inner workings of the high level interface
functions.</P>
<P>In this section we consider the function <B>f</B>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
function [y z] = f(a, b)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<H3>Selecting a runtime environment</H3>


<P>In order to run differentiated code, you must first select a
suitable runtime environment. This is done using the function
adimat_derivclass, for example like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
adimat_derivclass('opt_derivclass')
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The following combinations of differentiated functions and runtime
environments are possible:
<UL>
<LI>Functions differentiated in forward mode (those with prefix
<B>g_</B>): arrderivclass, arrderivclassvxdd, opt_derivclass,
opt_sp_derivclass, mat_derivclass, or scalar_directderivs.</LI>
<LI>Functions differentiated in alternative forward mode (those with
prefix <B>d_</B>): vector_directderivs.</LI>
<LI>Functions differentiated in reverse mode (those with prefix
<B>a_</B>): arrderivclass, arrderivclassvxdd, opt_derivclass,
opt_sp_derivclass, mat_derivclass, or scalar_directderivs.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Using any of the runtime environments, except scalar_directderivs,
enables you to use <EM>vector mode</EM>, i.e. the differentiated function
is run just once, computing derivatives along all derivative
directions, which are given by the columns of the seed matrix, at
once.</P>
<P>Using the scalar_directderivs runtime environment will use
<EM>scalar mode</EM>, i.e. only a single directional derivative can be
computed with each invocation of the differentiated
function. The 
<A HREF="#hlui">high level interface</A> functions
will automatically revert to <EM>strip mining</EM>, i.e. run the
differentiated function once for each derivative direction
specified. If you do the derivative evaluation step manually you have
to take care of this yourself.</P>
<P>Using one of the runtime environments opt_derivclass,
opt_sp_derivclass, or mat_derivclass, the derivative variables will be
objects of the <EM>derivative class</EM> contained in the respective
runtime environment. Using these classes tends to be rather slow
because of the overloaded operator resolution at runtime. However,
amortization starts when a large number of directional derivatives are
compted.</P>
<P>Using the runtime environments scalar_directderivs or
vector_directderivs, the derivative variables will be of native arrays
of type double.</P>
<P>In Octave since version 3.6 classes are supported, and hence also
the ADiMat derivative classes can be used. In older versions only the
runtime environments scalar_directderivs and vector_directderivs are
available.</P>
<H3><A NAME="run_fm_funcs"></A> Running forward mode functions </H3>

<P>To run one of the functions differentiated in forward mode, you
have to perform the following steps:
<UL>
<LI>Create derivative input arguments from the function arguments</LI>
<LI>Run the differentiated function</LI>
<LI>Extract derivatives from the derivative output arguments</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>For the first step, you should use one of the functions
createFullGradients or createSeededGradientsFor. If you want to compute
the full Jacobian, i.e. use the conforming identity matrix as the seed
matrix, you can use createFullGradients:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[g_a g_b] = createFullGradients(a, b);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you want to specify a seed matrix S, use:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[g_a g_b] = createSeededGradientsFor(S, a, b);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>For the second step, running the differentiated function, place the
derivative arguments created in the previous step before the
respective arguments in the input argument list, and do likewise for
derivative outputs:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[g_y y g_z z] = g_f(g_a, a, g_b, b);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If in doubt, consult the function signature in the file g_f.m or
d_f.m.</P>
<P>Finally you can extract the computed derivatives from the
derivative outputs. It is recommended to do this using the function
admJacFor:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Jacobian = admJacFor(g_y, g_z);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You can also manually extract the derivative values from the
derivative outputs. If you are using one of the derivative classes,
use curly brace indexing. To extract the i-th directional derivative
of y from g_y, use the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
dirder = g_y{i};
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You can also extract all derivative values at once using the :
wildcard index. This will concatenate all directional derivatives into
one large array. However, the ordering of the derivative values may
not be as you expected and it may differ depending on the derivative
class used.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
dvals = [g_y{:}];
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>When you used the alternative forward mode and the
vector_directderivs runtime environment, the i-th directional
derivative is contained in the i-th slice along the first dimension of
the array. The expression d_y(i, :) will always return all those
values in d_y in the form of a row vector, regardless of the number of
dimensions of d_y. You can then use reshape to make the directional
derivative have the same shape as y:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
dirder = reshape(d_y(i, :), size(y));

<H3>Running reverse mode functions</H3>

<P>To run a function differentiated in reverse mode, you have to
perform the following steps:
<UL>
<LI>Create derivative input arguments from the function results</LI>
<LI>Run the differentiated function</LI>
<LI>Extract derivatives from the derivative output arguments</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>In the first step you create <EM>adjoint</EM> variables of the
function's results. These will be given as <EM>input</EM> arguments to the
adjoint (reverse mode differentiated) function.</P>
<P>Thus, for the first step, you need the results that the function
produces at the desired input arguments. Actually only the size and
shape of the results is required, but for simplicity just run the
original function once:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[y z] = f(a, b);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Using one of the 
<A HREF="#hlui">high level interface</A>
functions, you should pass the function results via the option field
functionResults, otherwise admDiffRev will automatically run the
function to obtain this information.</P>
<P>Now you can use either createFullGradients or createSeededGradientsRev
to construct the adjoint arguments. If you want to compute the full
Jacobian, i.e. use the conforming identity matrix as the seed matrix,
you can use createFullGradients:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[a_y a_z] = createFullGradients(y, z);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you want to specify a seed matrix S, use:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[a_y a_z] = createSeededGradientsRev(S, y, z);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>For the second step, running the differentiated function, place the
derivative arguments created in the previous step at the end of the
orignal function's argument list. The adjoint outputs come first in
the adjoint function's output list, followed by the function
results. Thus, run the adjoint function like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[a_a a_b y z] = a_f(a, b, a_y, a_z);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If in doubt, consult the function signature in the file a_f.m.</P>
<P>The derivate output arguments a_a and a_b are the adjoints of the
function's <EM>input</EM> parameters, and thus contain the desired
derivative values. You can extract the computed derivatives from them
using the function admJacRev:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Jacobian = admJacRev(a_a, a_b);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you want to extract the derivatives manually, refer to the
description in the previous secion: 
<A HREF="#run_fm_funcs">here</A>.</P>
<H2><A NAME="exampleAD"></A> <A NAME="ss4.6">4.6</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc4.6">Applying AD to an example</A>
</H2>


<P>The above steps are applied to an example code now, the lighthouse
example which is introduced in the book by A. Griwank:
<A HREF="adimat-19.html#Griewank">A. Griewank: Evaluating derivatives</A>. The
function describing the coordinate where the beam of a lighthouse hits
a quay wall is given by:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
function y=lighthouse(nu, gamma, omega, t)
% The lighthouse example from the book:
% A. Griewank "Evaluating Derivatives" SIAM 2000 p. 16
y(1) = (nu * tan(omega*t))/(gamma-tan(omega*t));
y(2) = gamma*(nu * tan(omega*t))/(gamma-tan(omega*t));
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You could create function input parameters and run the function as
follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
n = 10; % (m)
g = 0.375* pi; % (bogenmass)
o = 0.0001* pi; % (bogenmass)
t = 2; % (s)
y = lighthouse(n, g, o, t);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Look into the book for a more detailed description.</P>
<H3>Example using the high-level interface</H3>

<P>Using the high level interface you can obtain the derivative in
forward mode by entering one of the following two commands:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[J y] = admDiffFor(@lighthouse, 1, n, g, o, t);
[J y] = admDiffVFor(@lighthouse, 1, n, g, o, t);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>In forward mode, four derivative directions are needed, as there
are a total of four components in the four scalar inputs. The
resulting Jacobian matrix in J will have two rows and four columns.</P>
<P>If you want to specify a seed matrix, pass it as the second
argument. The seed matrix must have four columns. The same result as
in the previous example can be obtained by manually passing the
four-by-four identity matrix:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
S = eye(4);
[J y] = admDiffFor(@lighthouse, S, n, g, o, t);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you wanted to compute just the first column of the Jacobian, you
could pass a single column vector of length four, setting its first
argument to one:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
S = [1 0 0 0]';
[J y] = admDiffFor(@lighthouse, S, n, g, o, t);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>However, in this case it is better to specify that only the first
parameter shall be independent, as the derivative code will by shorter:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
opts = admOptions('i', 1);
[J y] = admDiffFor(@lighthouse, 1, n, g, o, t, opts);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>In both cases the the resulting J will be a two-by-one matrix, the
first column of the full Jacobian.</P>
<P>For the reverse mode using the high level interface, type in the
following command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[J y] = admDiffRev(@lighthouse, 1, n, g, o, t);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>In reverse mode, only two derivative directions are needed, as
there are a total of two components in the single output variable
y. The resulting Jacobian matrix in J will of course again have two
rows and four columns.</P>
<P>Again, if you want to specify a seed matrix, pass it as the second
argument. The seed matrix must have two rows. The same result as in
the previous example can be obtained by manually passing the
two-by-two identity matrix:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
S = eye(2);
[J y] = admDiffRev(@lighthouse, S, n, g, o, t);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you wanted to compute just the first row of the Jacobian, you
could pass a single row vector of length two, setting its first
argument to one:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
S = [1 0];
[J y] = admDiffRev(@lighthouse, S, n, g, o, t);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>In this case you cannot use the dependent option to do this, as
there is only a single output parameter.</P>
<H3>Example doing the differentiation steps manually</H3>

<P>You can also compute the full Jacobian in forward mode by running
the following commands:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
admTransform(@lighthouse); % produces g_lighthouse.m
adimat_derivclass('opt_derivclass'); % select runtime environment
% adimat_derivclass('arrderivclass'); % possible alternative
S = eye(4); % create seed matrix
[g_n g_g g_o g_t] = createSeededGradientsFor(S, n, g, o, t); % create derivative inputs
[g_y y] = g_lighthouse(g_n, n, g_g, g, g_o, o, g_t, t); % run the differentiated function
J = admJacFor(g_y); % extract derivative values
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Using the alternative forward mode implementation, this becomes:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
admTransform(@lighthouse, admOptions('m', 'f')); % produces d_lighthouse.m
adimat_derivclass('vector_directderivs'); % select runtime environment
S = eye(4); % create seed matrix

[d_y y] = d_lighthouse(d_n, n, d_g, g, d_o, o, d_t, t); % run the differentiated function
J = admJacFor(d_y); % extract derivative values
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Using the reverse mode, you need to run the following commands:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
admTransform(@lighthouse, admOptions('m', 'r')); % produces a_lighthouse.m
adimat_derivclass('opt_derivclass'); % select runtime environment
% adimat_derivclass('arrderivclass'); % possible alternative
y = lighthouse(n, g, o, t); % run the original function (get y)
S = eye(2); % create seed matrix
[a_y] = createSeededGradientsRev(S, y); % create derivative inputs (adjoint of y)
[a_n a_g a_o a_t y] = a_lighthouse(n, g, o, t, a_y); % run the differentiated function
J = admJacRev(a_n, a_g, a_o, a_t); % extract derivative values
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<H3>Example using the scalar mode manually</H3>

<P>In this example we will do as many steps as possible without using
the runtime environment functions. You can compute a certain
directional derivative along the direction four-vector [a b c d] in
scalar mode by running the following commands:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
admTransform(@lighthouse); % produces g_lighthouse.m
adimat_derivclass('scalar_directderivs'); % select runtime environment for scalar mode
g_n = zeros(size(n)); % create zero derivative inputs
g_g = zeros(size(g)); % create zero derivative inputs
g_o = zeros(size(o)); % create zero derivative inputs
g_t = zeros(size(t)); % create zero derivative inputs
g_n(1) = a; % set derivative direction
g_g(1) = b; % set derivative direction
g_o(1) = c; % set derivative direction
g_t(1) = d; % set derivative direction
[g_y y] = g_lighthouse(g_n, n, g_g, g, g_o, o, g_t, t); % run the differentiated function
dirder = g_y(:); % extract derivative values
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Using the reverse mode, you can compute a certain reverse
directional derivative along the direction two-vector [a b] in scalar
mode by running the following commands:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
admTransform(@lighthouse, admOptions('m', 'r')); % produces a_lighthouse.m
adimat_derivclass('scalar_directderivs'); % select runtime environment for scalar mode
y = lighthouse(n, g, o, t); % run the original function (get y)
a_y = zeros(size(y)); % create zero derivative inputs
a_y(1) = a; % set derivative direction
a_y(2) = b; % set derivative direction
[a_n a_g a_o a_t y] = a_lighthouse(n, g, o, t, a_y); % run the differentiated function
rdirder = [a_n a_g a_o a_t]; % extract derivative values
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you want to compute the gradient of a scalar function f(a, b,
c), simply stick a one into the adjoint input parameter:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
admTransform(@f, admOptions('m', 'r')); % produces a_f.m
adimat_derivclass('scalar_directderivs'); % select runtime environment for scalar mode
[a_a a_b a_c z] = a_f(a, b, c, 1); % run the differentiated function
gradient = [a_a(:).' a_b(:).' a_c(:).'];                        % concatenate derivative values into gradient

<H2><A NAME="ss4.7">4.7</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc4.7">Using sparsity exploitation or compression</A>
</H2>

<P>In first order FM or RM, when the Jacobian matrix is sparse,
i.e. it has a lot of zero entries, then the number of directional
derivatives can often be reduced drastically, which is called
<I>sparsity exploitation</I>. This works by <I>compressing</I> the
Jacobian matrix. The non-zero pattern of the Jacobian is required for
this.</P>
<P>You can obtain the non-zero pattern P approximately by first
computing the full Jacobian J and then setting <CODE>P = J ~=
0</CODE>. This is however slightly dangerous, because some entries in J may
just happen to be zero at the particular point where you evaluated the
derivative, but be non-zero at other points. You can be conservative
in choosing P, i.e. mark more components of J as non-zeros than
necessary.</P>
<H3>Using sparsity exploitation with the high-level interface</H3>

<P>Using the high-level interface, you have to set the option field
JPattern to the non-zero pattern P. Then you can run admDiffFor as
usual, compression will automatically be used:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
opts.JPattern = P;
admDiffFor(@f, 1, arg1, ..., argN, opts)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The same thing works with admDiffVFor, admDiffRev, admDiffFD, and
admDiffComplex. The example above will implicitly use the conforming
identity matrix as the seed matrix, and compress it using the
<I>coloring heuristic</I> function cpr. This results in a compressed
seed matrix, which often has significantly fewer columns (fewer rows
in RM), thereby allowing for a faster derivative computation. The
results is a <I>compressed Jacobian</I>, which will automatically be
unpacked to a sparse matrix, identical to J.</P>
<P>The coloring heuristic cpr comes with ADiMat and implements the
Curtis-Powell-Reed heuristic. You can replace this heuristic by
another function with a similar signature.</P>
<P>You can also use sparsity exploitation on top of a custom seed
matrix S. Also, you can set a custom coloring function using the
option <CODE>coloringFunction</CODE>.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
opts.JPattern = P;
opts.coloringFunction = 'mycoloring';
admDiffFor(@f, S, arg1, ..., argN, opts)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<H3>Using sparsity exploitation manually</H3>

<P>If you compute derivatives repeatedly, but with a fixed non-zero
pattern, you may want to factor out the coloring and seed matrix
compression process from the differentiation process. This can be done
as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[cS coloring] = admColorSeed(P, opts); % construct compressed seed matrix
cJac = admDiffFor(@f, cS, arg1, ..., argN, opts); % run differentiation
Jac = admUncompressJac(cJac, P, coloring); % unpack the compressed Jacobian
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The same thing works with admDiffVFor, admDiffFD, and
admDiffComplex. You can also 
<A HREF="#evaluation">run the transformed code</A> manually. You could even use an entirely different
FM AD tool to compute the compressed Jacobian in the second line
instead of ADiMat.</P>
<P>In RM, however, you have to do something slightly
different. Instead of compressing columns of the seed matrix, you have
to compress rows. This can be achieved as follows, using transpose
operations:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[cS coloring] = admColorSeed(P.');                       % construct compressed seed matrix
cJac = admDiffRev(@f, cS.', arg1, ..., argN, opts);      % run differentiation
Jac = admUncompressJac(cJac.', P.', coloring); % unpack the compressed Jacobian
Jac = Jac.';                                             % final transpose
</PRE>
