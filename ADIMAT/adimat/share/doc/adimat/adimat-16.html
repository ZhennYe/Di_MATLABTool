<P>
<DL>
<DT><B> What is the order of derivative objects and results or parameters in a
function call?</B><DD>
<P>With <B>admDiffFor</B> and <B>admDiffVFor</B> the order of derivate
objects and results or parameters in a function is: The derivative
object preceeds its corresponding active result or active
parameter. For example: Let [y,w]=f(a,b,c) be a function having
the parameters a,b, and c and the results y and
w. Assume that the parameters a and c and the output
y are active. The correct call of this function is:
[g_y,y,w]=f(g_a,a,b,g_c,c).</P>
<P>With <B>admDiffRev</B> derivative outputs (adjoints of input parameters)
get prepended to the output parameter list and derivative inputs
(adjoints of output parameters) get appended to the input parameter
list.
<A NAME="q_placement_of_deriv_stmts"></A> </P>
<DT><B>Is the derivative assignment put in front of the orginial expression?</B><DD>
<P><B>admDiffFor</B>: The derivative assignment is put in front of the
original assignment usually. The exceptions to this rule are
assignments with LHSs with the backslash operator or other builtins
with BMFUNC DIFFSTO rules that use the original expression's result
($$). In this case the original expression is assigned
to a temporary variable which the derivative expression can use, and
after that the temporary expression is assigned to its original
variable.</P>
<P><B>admDiffVFor</B>: Only when an active variable is assigned a constant
(non-active) value is the corresponding <CODE>d_zeros</CODE> assignment placed
after the original assignment, so the RHSs value can be used there.</P>
<DT><B>Which prefix do derivative objects get?</B><DD>
<P><B>admDiffFor</B>: Derivative objects are prefixed with 'g_' by
default. This may be changed using the
parameter 
<A HREF="adimat-8.html#p_gradprefix">gradprefix</A>.</P>
<P><B>admDiffVFor</B>: Derivative objects are prefixed with 'd_'
by default. This may be changed using the
parameter 
<A HREF="adimat-8.html#p_forward-deriv-variable-prefix">forward-deriv-variable-prefix</A>.</P>
<P><B>admDiffRev</B>: Derivative objects are prefixed with 'a_'
by default. This may be changed using the
parameter 
<A HREF="adimat-8.html#p_rev-prefix">rev-prefix</A>.</P>
<DT><B>Which prefix do differentiated functions get?</B><DD>
<P><B>admDiffFor</B>: A differentiated function gets the prefix 'g_'
by default. This may be changed using the parameter
option 
<A HREF="adimat-8.html#p_funcprefix">funcprefix</A>.</P>
<P><B>admDiffVFor</B>: Derivative functions are prefixed with
'd_' by default. This may be changed using the
parameter 
<A HREF="adimat-8.html#p_forward-deriv-function-prefix">forward-deriv-function-prefix</A>.</P>
<P><B>admDiffRev</B>: Adjoint functions are prefixed with 'a_' by
default. This may be changed using the
parameter 
<A HREF="adimat-8.html#p_rev-prefix">rev-prefix</A>. Recording
(forward-sweep) functions are prefixed with 'rec_' by default,
changeable using the parameter 
<A HREF="adimat-8.html#p_rec-prefix">rec-prefix</A>. Returning (reverse-sweep) functions are prefixed
with 'ret_' by default, changeable using the
parameter 
<A HREF="adimat-8.html#p_ret-prefix">ret-prefix</A>.</P>
<DT><B>How can I put each generated function into a different file</B><DD>
<P>With <B>admDiffVFor</B> and <B>admDiffRev</B> all generated functions are
placed into a single file. You can set the parameter
<CODE>output-mode</CODE> to <CODE>split-all</CODE> to change that. Be careful when
using this as this may in certain circumstances overwrite some of your
existing files.
<A NAME="q_how_to_avoid_subsref_subsasgn"></A> </P>
<DT><B>How can I avoid having to use use-subsref and use-subsasgn</B><DD>
<P>In some situations, admDiffVFor will only work if the parameters
use-subsref and/or use-subsasgn are turned on. Since these options
make the AD code much slower, it may be worth the effort to change the
code in such a way that they are not necessary any more.</P>
<P>One such situation that may cause trouble is when you have a row
vector and in your code index into it using a single index, like this:
v(i), or like this: v(1:n). Try to change these expressions to v(1,i)
and v(1,1:n), resp.
<A NAME="q_performance_tips"></A> </P>
<DT><B>How can I achieve a better performance</B><DD>
<P> There are several things you can try in order to achieve a better
performance:
<UL>
<LI>First of all: try to write vectorized code.</LI>
<LI>When you have a rather small function, then the high-level
drivers such as admDiffFor and adnDiffRev may require more time for
performing all the useful checks and tests than for the actual
derivative computation. Most of these checks can be turned off, using
the option <CODE>nochecks</CODE>:
<PRE>
  adopts = admOptions();
  adopts.nochecks = true;
</PRE>

This is a shortcut option with the same effect as setting the
following options:
<PRE>
  adopts.forceTransform = -1;
  adopts.checkDependencies = false;
  adopts.checkResultSizes = false;
  adopts.checknargs = false;
  adopts.checkoptions = false;
</PRE>

Not however that this will in particular turn off the check whether
the differentiated files are up to date. So it may be wise to run a
dummy call <I>without</I> option <CODE>nocheck</CODE> before turning it on.</LI>
<LI>When using admDiffFor, try the different derivative
classes (see 
<A HREF="adimat-7.html#derivclass">The derivative classes</A>) to see
which one is the fastest for you.</LI>
<LI>When you compute a Jacobian, see if it is sparse, so you might be
able to apply compression. In exceptional cases, compression with the
reverse mode may be an idea, if the Jacobian can be better compressed
along the rows. Try admColorSeed with both the pattern and the
transposed pattern to see if it makes a difference. Certain Jacobian
with peculiar sparsity patterns (e.g. array shape) can be efficiently
computed by a combination of the FM and RM, though you would have to
do that manually.</LI>
<LI>When the NDD is low, but &gt; 1 (for example after applying
compression), and you are using admDiffFor or admDiffRev, you may try
whether <I>strip mining</I> is faster than vector mode. The reason is
that vector mode needs the derivative classes, which are rather
slow. The only amortize when there is a certain minimum NDD. There are
two ways to do this: Either set the option scalarModeSwitch to some
number higher that your NDD or you set the option derivClassName to
'scalar_directderivs'.</LI>
<LI>When using admDiffRev, try if in your code you can turn off the
use of wrapper functions that deal with scalar expansion and implicit
reshapes.
<PRE>
  adopts = admOptions();
  adopts.parameters.allowArrayGrowth = 0;
  adopts.parameters.adjointReductions = 'no';
  adopts.parameters.adjointReshapes = 'no';
  adopts.parameters.avoidVarargFunctions = 1;
</PRE>
</LI>
</UL>

<A NAME="q_cleanup_generated_code"></A> </P>
<DT><B>How can I clean up the files generated by ADiMat</B><DD>
<P>You can use the function <B>admClean</B> (cf. 
<A HREF="adimat-6.html#admClean">admClean</A>).
<A NAME="q_check_derivatives"></A> </P>
<DT><B>How can I check derivatives for correctness</B><DD>
<P>You should always check the AD derivatives that come out of ADiMat for
correctness, at least initially and then after major changes to your
code. We suggest that you test all three AD drivers and also the FD
and complex variable method drivers (see 
<A HREF="adimat-4.html#hlui">High level user interface</A>) to compute the desired derivative. Then
compute the relative error between any two of the resulting Jacobians
J1 and J2 like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
norm(J1 - J2) ./ norm(J1)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The relative error between any of the AD and the complex variable
method derivatives should be very small, while the relative error
between one of these and the FD derivatives have about the size of
<CODE>sqrt(eps)</CODE>. You can use the functions <B>admAllDiff</B> and
<B>admAllDiffMatrix</B> for this. See also
our 
<A HREF="adimat-17.html#ex_check_derivatives">example notebook</A> on this
topic.
<A NAME="q_behind_proxy"></A> </P>
<DT><B>I am behind a web proxy which blocks me from accessing the transformation server. What can I do?</B><DD>
<P>The ADiMat transformation server has been configured to listen also on
the port 10443 for SSL connections in addition to the standard port
443. In some cases using this port allows you to get around the proxy.</P>
<P>You can tell adimat-client to use this alternative port using one of
these methods:
<UL>
<LI>On the command-line, pass the
option <CODE>--server=https://adimat.sc.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de:10443/</CODE>
to adimat-client.</LI>
<LI>Within Matlab, you can add this same option to the <CODE>flags</CODE> field of admOptions.</LI>
<LI>Or you can set the server URL using the field <CODE>server</CODE> of
admOptions.</LI>
</UL>

<A NAME="q_ignore_unbound"></A> </P>
<DT><B>How can I tell ADiMat to ignore unbound identifiers?</B><DD>
<P>You can give the flag <CODE>-b</CODE> to adimat-client, which will cause it
to not generate errors when it encounters an unbound
identifier. Unbound identifiers are most likely toolbox functions that
ADiMat does not know. These may also include functions from ADiMat's
runtime environment.
<A NAME="q_retransform"></A> </P>
<DT><B>I want to send ADiMat generated code to the server again, but I
get errors</B><DD>
<P>ADiMat generates code which may contain many calls to various runtime
functions. These have often not been added to the function data base
yet. Hence you will get errors complaining about unbound identifiers
when you try to tranform this code again.</P>
<P>See the 
<A HREF="#q_ignore_unbound">previous question</A> on how
to suppress these.</P>
