<P>We think ADiMat is now fairly complete, apart from the fact that
there are still many builtins which it cannot differentiate. However,
our feeling is that a large number of codes can be differentiated
straight away. In other cases, with some slight modifications you may
be able to differentiate your code succesfully. This section lists
some common practices.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc5.1">Differentiating functions with char, int, struct or cell parameters</A>
</H2>

<P>ADiMat assumes that the input and output parameters of the function
to differentiate are double arrays. When an in- or output parameter is
of type char, int, struct of cell instead, some special measures must
be taken. In the following discussion we treat input parameters, output
parameters can be handled analogously.
We have to distinguish two possible cases:
<OL>
<LI>The parameter is not an independent variable: if you specify
this, there should be no problem</LI>
<LI>The parameter is an independent variable: you should use a
wrapper function</LI>
</OL>

In the first case, the parameter contains values, possibly strings,
maybe also numbers, that parametrize the function. Simply tell ADiMat
not to differentiate w.r.t. that parameter, using the independents
option field. For example, consider the following function:
<PRE>
function z = f(a, options)
   if strcmp(options.mode, 'fast')
      z = fast(a);
   else
      z = slow(a);
   end
   if options.postprocess == 1
      z = post(z);
   end
</PRE>

This function should be differentiated passing admOptions('i', 1) as
the options structure. This excludes the second parameter from
differentiation, and then there should be no problems.
In the second case, the parameter contains some float values which are
independent variables of your function. In this case you can write a
wrapper function, which receives the independent values of interest in
dedicated floating point parameters. The wrapper then places these
values in the correct location in the struct or cell array and calls
the original function. Consider the following example function:
<PRE>
function z = f(variables, options)
   if strcmp(options.mode, 'fast')
      z = fast(variables.x * 2, variables.y * 0.5);
   else
      z = slow(variables.x * 2, variables.y * 0.5);
   end
   if options.postprocess == 1
      z = post(z);
   end
</PRE>

The wrapper you could use might look like this:
<PRE>
function z = fwrap(x, y, variables, options)
   variables.x = x;
   variables.y = y;
   z = f(variables, options);
</PRE>

Instead of the original f, you should now differentiate fwrap, passing
admOptions('i', 1:2) as the options structure.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc5.2">Differentiating code in multiple directories</A>
</H2>

<P>The high-level interfaces of ADiMat, e.g. admDiffFor, will find the
source code of the top-level function by using the <B>which</B> command, even
if it resides in a different directory. It will also automatically
append and appropriate -I switch to the command line, such that
further functions in that directory are also found. However, if some
of the functions called from the code reside in a second directory,
you have to add the corresponding -I switch manually.
Example: say your code is in two directories, src/a and
src/b. Function f is in src/a and calls g, which is in src/b. For
running your code you would use:
<PRE>
addpath('src/a');
addpath('src/b');
z = f(a, b);
</PRE>

As stated, f.m can be found automatically by admDiffFor via the which
command. However, ADiMat will then complain that g is an undefined
identifier. You must pass admOptions('f', ' -I src/b ') as the options
structure to the AD based differentiation routines admDiffFor
et. al. Note this is not necessary with admDiffFD or admDiffComplex.</P>
