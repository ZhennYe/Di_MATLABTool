  This guide describes ADiMat 0.6.0.

  1.  Installation on Linux or Unix systems


  1. Unpack the download archive. A directory called
     adimat-0.6.0-4726-GNU_Linux-i686 (32 Bit version) or
     adimat-0.6.0-4726-GNU_Linux-x86_64 (64 Bit version) is created.
     This is the ADiMat home directory. Before you proceed with the
     following steps, you may rename or move this directory as you like,
     for example to /opt/adimat.

  2. Within Matlab (or Octave), navigate to the directory where you
     installed ADiMat, which contains this file (Install.txt). Execute
     the following command:


       ADiMat_startup



  This adds several directories of ADiMat to the path, and also sets the
  environment variable $ADIMAT_HOME. You probably wish to make this
  change permanent, to do this, execute ADiMat_startup from your
  startup.m (Matlab) or ~/.octaverc (Octave). For example add this line:


       run('/opt/adimat/ADiMat_startup');



  The following two steps are optional, if you want to also use ADiMat
  from the command line:

  1. Create an environment variable, ADIMAT_HOME, that contains the path
     to the ADiMat home directory. To do this, in your shell (sh, bash,
     or zsh) execute this command:


       export ADIMAT_HOME=/opt/adimat



  Add this line to your shell's startup file, e.g. ~/.bashrc, to set it
  at startup time.

  2. You should also set your PATH variable to include $ADIMAT_HOME/bin,
     which you do by typing something like this in your ~/.bashrc


       export PATH=$PATH:$ADIMAT_HOME/bin



  Optionally, also set


       INFOPATH=$INFOPATH:$ADIMAT_HOME/share/doc/adimat



  to read this documentation in the info pager.

  For any questions feel free to contact us via the ADiMat Users mailing
  list <mailto:adimat-users@lists.sc.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>.

  In order to build and install ADiMat from the sources, read the file
  BUILD in the base directory of the ADiMat source distribution.
